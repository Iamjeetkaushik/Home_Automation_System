# Home_Automation_System
This repository is a combined project of Jeet Kaushik, Mounish Vatti, and Abhishek Agarwal, which aims to sync electronics and code together to automate lifestyle.

Our Project is "IOT Home Automation" 

It includes using a photodetector, attached outside the window to measure the intensity of the sunlight and change the light intensities of LEDs' in room accordingly.
Photodetector also controls a servo to control blinds of the window, as the intensity of sunligth increses/decreases servo opens/closes the blinds of window. For eg
-- blinds will be closed during night and slowly opens as the sun rises in morning.

Whereas, light intensity of LEDs' in room is inversly related to the intensity of sunligth. So, during daytime lights will be off, by the evening they will start to
glow and by the night, illuminating rooms with brigth light.
